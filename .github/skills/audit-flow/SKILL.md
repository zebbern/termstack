## ⚠️ MANDATORY ENTRY POINT — Execute Before ANY Other Action

**Step 1: Read schema.sql**
```bash
# ALWAYS read the schema first to understand tables, constraints, views
cat .claude/skills/audit-flow/schema.sql
```

**Step 2: Check if DB exists — NEVER recreate**
```bash
# Check for existing database
ls -la .audit/audit.db 2>/dev/null && echo "DB EXISTS - DO NOT RECREATE" || echo "No DB - safe to init"
```

**Step 3: If DB exists, show current state**
```bash
python .claude/skills/audit-flow/scripts/audit.py list
```

### 🚫 FORBIDDEN ACTIONS

| Action | Why Forbidden |
|--------|---------------|
| `rm .audit/audit.db` | Destroys audit history |
| `audit.py init` when DB exists | Overwrites existing data |
| `DROP TABLE` | Destroys audit history |
| `sqlite3 .audit/audit.db < schema.sql` when DB exists | Overwrites existing data |

**Rule:** If `.audit/audit.db` exists, ONLY use `audit.py list`, `show`, `export`, or INSERT operations. NEVER recreate.

# Audit Flow

Interactive tracing of system flows with SQLite persistence. Supports multiple named flows per session, non-linear flows (branching/merging), and multi-format exports.

## Organization Principles

**Directory structure by purpose:**
- **Audits/Documentation/Compliance:** `docs/audits/{name}-{YYYY-MM-DD}/`
- **Ideation/Brainstorming:** `docs/ideation/{name}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md` (single file, no subdirectory unless artifacts needed)
- **Debugging/Incident Review:** `docs/audits/{name}-{YYYY-MM-DD}/` (same as audits — captures evidence)
- **Architecture Review:** `docs/audits/{name}-{YYYY-MM-DD}/` (same as audits — captures structural analysis)

**Required files:**
- INDEX.md (manifest, entry point)
- README.md (executive summary)
- {name}-audit.md (flow trace)

**Lazy initialization:** Create subdirectories only when artifacts exist
- `screenshots/` `network-traces/` `diagrams/` `code-samples/` `test-results/` `evidence/`

**Naming:** `{audit-name}-{type}.md`

## DB-First Discipline

**Invariant:** SQLite = sole source of truth. Context window: volatile, compacts without notice, hallucinates state.

**🚨 CRITICAL: NEVER DESTROY EXISTING DATA**
- If `.audit/audit.db` exists → it contains irreplaceable audit history
- NEVER run `init` when DB exists — use `list` to see what's there
- NEVER delete, drop, or recreate — only append

**Constraints:**

| Operation | Rule | Blocked rationalization |
|-----------|------|------------------------|
| **Entry** | Read `schema.sql` FIRST, check if DB exists SECOND | "I'll just start working" |
| **Init** | ONLY if `.audit/audit.db` does NOT exist | "Let me reinitialize to start fresh" |
| Schema | Read `schema.sql` BEFORE any SQLite command — understand tables, constraints, views first | "I know the schema from context" |
| Write | INSERT each tuple/edge/finding before moving to the next code location | "I'll batch-insert at the end" |
| Read | SELECT from DB before referencing tuple IDs, counts, or flow structure | "I remember the flow so far" |
| Export | `audit.py export` only — never generate mermaid/markdown from context | "Let me generate mermaid directly" |
| Resume | `audit.py show <session>` before any operation that references prior tuples | "I have the full trace in context" |
| Reference | Query tuple IDs from DB — IDs are DB-assigned, never inferred | "The tuple ID should be N" |
| **Default** | **When uncertain of flow state → query DB before proceeding** | *(any unlisted rationalization)* |

**Checkpoint:** Every 5 tuples → `audit.py show <session> <flow>`

## Interactive Workflow - ALWAYS ASK USER

### 1. Session Start - Ask:
```
Name: ___
Purpose: security-audit | documentation | compliance | ideation | brainstorming | debugging | architecture-review | incident-review
Description: ___ (optional)
```

Initialize directory immediately. Lazily create subdirectories when artifacts are generated.

### 2. Granularity - Ask:
```
[fine]   Function-level trace (~50-200 tuples)
         Use: Security audits, debugging

[coarse] Boundary-level trace (~10-30 tuples)
         Use: Documentation, high-level flows

Choose: fine / coarse
```

### 3. During Trace:
Ask at decision points: trace deeper? mark concern? add finding (severity)? note?

### 4. On Export:
Ask format: `json | yaml | md | mermaid | all`

Post-export: Generate INDEX.md manifest. Organize artifacts by type. Prune empty directories.

## Quick Reference

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/audit-flow start` | New session (name, purpose, granularity) |
| `/audit-flow flow {name}` | Add new flow to session |
| `/audit-flow add {layer} {desc}` | Add tuple to current flow |
| `/audit-flow link {from} {to} {rel}` | Create edge (supports conditions for branches) |
| `/audit-flow finding {desc}` | Record finding |
| `/audit-flow show` | View session/flow details |
| `/audit-flow export` | Export (json/yaml/md/mermaid) |
| `/audit-flow git-setup` | Configure git merge/diff drivers (once) |

**Layers:** `CODE` | `API` | `NETWORK` | `AUTH` | `DATA`

**Relations:** `TRIGGERS` | `READS` | `WRITES` | `VALIDATES` | `TRANSFORMS` | `BRANCHES` | `MERGES`

## Semantic Rules for Relations

| Relation | Meaning | Use When | NOT For |
|----------|---------|----------|---------|
| `TRIGGERS` | A causes B to execute | Function calls, event handlers, HTTP requests | Static observations |
| `READS` | A consumes data from B | Cookie reads, DB queries, config lookups | Mutations |
| `WRITES` | A mutates data in B | Cookie writes, DB inserts, state updates | Read-only access |
| `VALIDATES` | A checks/verifies B | Auth checks, input validation, expiry checks | Chaining analyst observations |
| `TRANSFORMS` | A converts/maps data for B | Token exchange, response formatting | Unrelated processing |
| `BRANCHES` | A has conditional paths | if/else, switch, error vs success | **Must have condition label** |
| `MERGES` | Multiple paths converge at B | Parallel paths rejoin, error recovery | Single-path flow |

**CRITICAL: BRANCHES Must Have Conditions.** Every BRANCHES edge requires a `condition` describing which path. Example: `BRANCHES [token expired]` vs `BRANCHES [token valid]`.

## Observations vs Flow Steps

**Flow steps** = things the SYSTEM DOES (function calls, data reads, network requests). Verified by tracing code.

**Observations** = things the ANALYST NOTES (missing features, potential risks). Record as **findings**, not tuples.

**Wrong pattern:**
```
T50 "NO cross-tab sync"       ← observation, not a system action
T51 "React state NOT shared"  ← observation
T50 --VALIDATES--> T51         ← chaining observations as flow
```

**Correct pattern:**
```sql
-- Record as finding instead:
INSERT INTO findings (flow_id, session_id, severity, category, description)
VALUES (?, ?, 'medium', 'state-management',
        'No cross-tab sync: React state not shared across tabs');
```

**Rule:** NEVER chain observations with VALIDATES. If describing what the system DOESN'T do, use a finding.

## Data Model

```
Session (audit container)
  └── Flow (named DAG with entry point)
       └── Tuple (node: layer + action + subject)
            └── Edge (relation + optional condition)
```

## Storage & CLI

```bash
# Core
python .claude/skills/audit-flow/scripts/audit.py init              # Initialize DB
python .claude/skills/audit-flow/scripts/audit.py list              # List sessions
python .claude/skills/audit-flow/scripts/audit.py show <session>    # Show flows
python .claude/skills/audit-flow/scripts/audit.py show <session> <flow>  # Show flow details
python .claude/skills/audit-flow/scripts/audit.py export <session>  # Export all
python .claude/skills/audit-flow/scripts/audit.py export <session> -f <flow>  # Export one flow
python .claude/skills/audit-flow/scripts/audit.py validate <session>         # Validate flows

# Git integration
python .claude/skills/audit-flow/scripts/audit.py git-setup         # Configure merge/diff drivers (once)
python .claude/skills/audit-flow/scripts/audit.py db-merge %O %A %B # Git merge driver (auto-called)

# CSV backup/portability (optional)
python .claude/skills/audit-flow/scripts/audit.py csv-export               # DB → .audit/csv/*.csv
python .claude/skills/audit-flow/scripts/audit.py csv-import               # .audit/csv/*.csv → DB
python .claude/skills/audit-flow/scripts/audit.py csv-merge <theirs_dir>   # Merge two CSV sets
```

## Non-Linear Flows

**Branching:** One tuple → multiple outgoing edges with conditions
```sql
INSERT INTO edges (from_tuple, to_tuple, relation, condition)
VALUES (5, 6, 'BRANCHES', 'token valid'),
       (5, 7, 'BRANCHES', 'token expired');
```

**Merging:** Multiple tuples → one tuple
```sql
INSERT INTO edges (from_tuple, to_tuple, relation)
VALUES (6, 8, 'TRIGGERS'),
       (9, 8, 'MERGES');  -- refresh path merges back
```

## Git Context

Capture on session start: commit hash, branch, working tree status. Include in all exports.

## Mermaid Validation

Run `python .claude/skills/audit-flow/scripts/audit.py validate <session>` before export.

| Check | Severity | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| BRANCHES without condition | ERROR | Every BRANCHES edge needs a condition label |
| Node count >= 60 | ERROR | Split into sub-flows |
| Node count >= 40 | WARN | Consider splitting |
| Orphan nodes | WARN | Node with no edges (disconnected) |
| Duplicate labels | WARN | Same action text without subject disambiguation |
| No entry point | WARN | All nodes have incoming edges |

**Post-export features (automatic):**
- **Step numbers**: BFS topological order from entry point (`1. action`, `2. action`)
- **Entry point**: Stadium shape with green styling
- **Edge arrows**: `-->` solid (TRIGGERS/VALIDATES/TRANSFORMS/BRANCHES/MERGES), `-.->` dotted (READS), `==>` thick (WRITES)
- **Observations**: Separated into dashed-border OBSERVATIONS subgraph
- **Direction**: `--direction LR` flag for horizontal layouts

## Diagram Readability Requirements

**All diagrams MUST be produced by `audit.py export`.** Never hand-craft mermaid. The exporter enforces:

1. **Entry point marker** — Green stadium-shape node `([label]):::entryPoint`
2. **Step numbers** — BFS topological order: `1. action`, `2. action`, `3. action`
3. **Legend block** — classDef styles for entryPoint, concern, observation
4. **Observation separation** — Concern-only chains go to OBSERVATIONS subgraph, not main flow
5. **Label safety** — HTML entities for `()`, `""`, `<>`, `|`, `[]` characters (auto-sanitized)

**Reading flow must be obvious.** A reader opening the diagram cold must immediately see:
- WHERE to start (green entry node)
- WHAT ORDER to read (step numbers)
- WHICH PATH is happy vs error (branch conditions on edges)
- WHAT THE COLORS MEAN (legend)

**Node label rules:**
- Use concrete nouns/verbs: `handleCallback()`, `exchangeCodeForTokens()`
- NOT bare verbs: ~~"Configure"~~, ~~"Select"~~, ~~"Enable"~~
- Disambiguate duplicates: auto-suffixed with subject when action repeats

**Size limits:**
- 40+ nodes → warning, consider splitting
- 60+ nodes → error, MUST split into sub-flows
- If flow has 5+ independent sub-flows → split by purpose

## Git Workflow — Custom Merge Driver

**Problem:** SQLite is binary — `git merge` can't auto-resolve `.audit/audit.db`.

**Solution:** Custom git merge driver. `audit.db` stays in git (small, single file). On conflict, git calls `audit.py db-merge` to auto-merge using SQL.

### One-Time Setup

```bash
python .claude/skills/audit-flow/scripts/audit.py git-setup
```

This configures (in `.git/config`):
- **Merge driver:** `merge.sqlite-audit` — calls `audit.py db-merge %O %A %B` on conflict
- **Diff driver:** `diff.sqlite` — `sqlite3 .dump` for readable `git diff` output

Also requires `.gitattributes` (already in repo):
```
.audit/audit.db diff=sqlite merge=sqlite-audit
```

### How It Works

1. You commit `audit.db` normally — `git add .audit/audit.db && git commit`
2. `git diff` shows SQL text (via textconv)
3. On `git merge` with conflict → git calls the merge driver automatically
4. Driver opens both DBs, merges sessions by name (later `updated_at` wins), remaps IDs
5. Result written to ours — merge completes cleanly

### Merge Strategy

| Table | Merge Key | Conflict Resolution |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| sessions | `name` (unique) | Keep later `updated_at` |
| flows | `(session_name, flow_name)` | Follow parent session winner |
| tuples | Parent flow | All tuples from winning flow kept |
| edges | Both endpoint tuples | Kept if both endpoints survive |
| findings | `(session_name, category, description)` | Dedup by content |

All INTEGER PKs remapped sequentially. Foreign keys updated.

### CSV Backup (Optional)

CSV export/import still available for portability and backup:
```bash
python .claude/skills/audit-flow/scripts/audit.py csv-export   # DB → .audit/csv/*.csv (QUOTE_ALL)
python .claude/skills/audit-flow/scripts/audit.py csv-import   # CSV → DB (recreates from scratch)
```

## Output Quality

**Principles:**
- ASCII sequence diagrams for complex flows
- Side-by-side tables for alternatives
- Real code from traced files with `file:line` references
- What/Why/Example pattern
- No generic templates

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] Directory exists with ISO date suffix
- [ ] INDEX.md manifest generated
- [ ] README.md (executive summary)
- [ ] Naming convention: `{name}-{type}.md`
- [ ] Artifacts in typed subdirectories (lazy init)
- [ ] Git context captured
- [ ] Git merge driver configured (`audit.py git-setup`)
- [ ] No orphaned files
- [ ] Diagrams pass `audit.py validate`

## Anti-Patterns

Flat structure, empty directories, orphan nodes, unlabeled branches, generic identifiers, missing git context, no manifest, hand-crafted mermaid, bare-verb labels.
