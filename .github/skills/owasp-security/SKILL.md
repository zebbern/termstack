## Step 1 — Identify Applicable OWASP Domains

Before scanning for vulnerabilities, analyse the codebase to determine which OWASP standards apply. Apply **the most current version of each standard you know**, and record both the version number and its publication date in the report header.

| Domain | Apply if you detect… |
|---|---|
| **OWASP Top 10 (Web)** | Web application, HTTP endpoints, browsers, HTML rendering |
| **OWASP API Security Top 10** | REST, GraphQL, gRPC, WebSocket, or any programmatic API |
| **OWASP LLM Top 10** | LLM calls, prompt construction, AI agent code, RAG pipelines, vector stores |
| **OWASP ML Security Top 10** | Model training, inference pipelines, feature engineering, model serving |
| **OWASP Mobile Top 10** | iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, or hybrid mobile code |
| **OWASP Cloud-Native Top 10** | Kubernetes, containers, serverless, IaC, cloud SDKs |
| **OWASP IoT Top 10** | Firmware, embedded, device management, hardware interfaces |
| **OWASP ASVS** | Compliance-driven review, formal security assessment, regulated industry (finance, healthcare, government) |

Apply every domain that matches the codebase. A single review can cover multiple domains.

> **Future-proofing note:** Apply all OWASP standards you are aware of that fit the codebase — this table is a starting point, not a ceiling. Notable recent additions: OWASP Top 10:2025 introduces **A03:2025 — Software Supply Chain Failures** and **A10:2025 — Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions** as new categories. The OWASP Software Component Verification Standard (SCVS) applies when the review scope includes dependency or supply-chain analysis. If you are uncertain whether a newer edition of any standard exists beyond your training data, flag it explicitly in the report header.

---

## Step 2 — Security Analysis

### Core categories (all domains)

- Input validation and output encoding (XSS, SQLi, NoSQLi, LDAPi, command injection, prompt injection)
- AuthN/AuthZ boundaries (IDOR/BOLA, missing checks, role confusion, token misuse)
- Secrets management (hardcoded secrets, tokens in code/logs/environment)
- Session management (tokens, cookie flags, CSRF, session fixation)
- Crypto (algorithms, modes, IVs/nonces, key length, random sources, deprecated primitives)
- File/OS/network access (path traversal, SSRF, open redirects, unsafe deserialization)
- Dependency risk (vulnerable libraries, known CVEs if inferable; supply chain integrity)
- Configuration (debug flags, CORS, security headers, TLS settings, overly permissive defaults)
- Logging and observability (PII in logs, log forging, missing security events)
- Exception handling (swallowed catches, overly broad exceptions, sensitive data in stack traces, missing resource cleanup, **fail-open vs. fail-closed patterns**, error message enumeration, unhandled async exceptions/promise rejections)
- Race conditions and concurrency (TOCTOU, double-spend, parallel request abuse, state mutation without locking)
- Business logic and abuse cases (price manipulation, coupon/reward abuse, workflow bypass, privilege escalation through flow manipulation, unrestricted access to sensitive business flows)

### AI/LLM-specific categories (when LLM/ML domain applies)

- Prompt injection and indirect prompt injection via untrusted data sources (documents, web content, tool outputs)
- Model supply-chain integrity (untrusted base models, compromised fine-tunes, dependency confusion in ML packages)
- Training data and model poisoning (backdoors, data contamination, label flipping)
- Insecure output handling (LLM output rendered as code, HTML, SQL, or shell commands without sanitisation)
- Excessive agency (LLM permitted to take destructive or irreversible actions without human confirmation)
- Sensitive data leakage through model context, conversation history, or training memorisation
- System prompt leakage (system prompts containing credentials, internal logic, or sensitive instructions exposed to users or downstream systems)
- Vector and embedding weaknesses (poisoned embeddings in RAG pipelines, insecure vector store access controls, embedding inversion attacks)
- Insecure plugin/tool invocation (unvalidated tool inputs, overly broad tool permissions, confused deputy attacks)
- Overreliance on model output in security-critical paths (auth decisions, medical/financial logic driven by unvalidated LLM output)
- Model denial-of-service (unbounded token consumption, recursive prompts, resource exhaustion via crafted inputs)
- Misinformation in security-critical contexts (model generating plausible but false guidance used in high-stakes decisions)

## Step 3 — Language and Framework Patterns

**High-priority file types:** entry points, controllers/handlers/routers, auth/session/crypto modules, data access layers, AI/LLM integration code, config files, dependency manifests.

### Vulnerability patterns by language

- **Python:** SQL injection in raw queries, pickle deserialization, `eval()`, path traversal, unsafe `yaml.load()`
- **JavaScript/Node.js:** Prototype pollution, unsafe `eval()`, path traversal, XSS in templates, ReDoS, unhandled promise rejections
- **Java:** Unsafe deserialization, XXE, LDAP injection, path traversal, expression language injection
- **C#/.NET:** Binary serialization, SQL injection, XML deserialization, unsafe reflection
- **Go:** SQL injection, path traversal, unsafe reflection, command injection, goroutine leaks
- **Ruby:** YAML deserialization, SQL injection, `eval()`, mass assignment, path traversal
- **PHP:** SQL injection via unparameterized queries, `unserialize()` deserialization, file inclusion (LFI/RFI), type juggling (`==` vs `===`), `extract()` variable injection, exposed `phpinfo()`, unsafe `eval()`
- **Rust:** `unsafe` block misuse, FFI boundary issues, panic-based denial-of-service, logic errors in ownership bypasses, integer overflow in release builds
- **Swift:** Insecure Keychain usage, URL scheme hijacking, insecure `NSCoding` deserialization, ATS (App Transport Security) exceptions, hardcoded credentials
- **Kotlin:** Null-safety bypasses via Java interop, coroutine cancellation and resource leaks, insecure Intent handling, exposed ContentProviders
- **C/C++:** Buffer overflows, use-after-free, format string vulnerabilities, integer overflows, double-free, uninitialized memory reads

### Framework-specific patterns

- **Spring (Java):** Expression language injection, unsafe deserialization, Spring Security misconfig, actuator endpoint exposure
- **Django (Python):** Template injection, unsafe pickle, ORM bypass, missing CSRF middleware, `DEBUG=True` in production
- **Express (Node.js):** Prototype pollution, unsafe templating, path traversal, missing `helmet`, overly permissive CORS
- **ASP.NET:** ViewState tampering, unsafe deserialization, SQL injection, missing security headers
- **Rails (Ruby):** Mass assignment, unsafe YAML, SQL injection, insecure `send`, open redirects via `redirect_to`
- **Next.js:** SSRF in server components, environment variables leaked into client bundles, middleware bypass via malformed requests, open redirects in `next.config.js` rewrites
- **FastAPI (Python):** Missing dependency injection auth, Pydantic validation bypass via union types, overly permissive CORS, unauthenticated docs endpoints (`/docs`, `/redoc`) in production
- **Gin (Go):** Missing middleware ordering (auth before handler), path traversal through parameter binding, missing rate limiting
- **Laravel (PHP):** Mass assignment via `$fillable`/`$guarded` misconfiguration, debug mode exposure, insecure encryption key management, unsafe `eval()` in Blade templates
- **LangChain / LlamaIndex:** Prompt injection via document ingestion, unsafe tool execution, agent loop escapes, insecure retrieval chain inputs
- **OpenAI / Anthropic SDK:** Unvalidated model output used in security decisions, missing output sanitisation, system prompt exposure via tool calls

### Container and IaC patterns (when Cloud-Native domain applies)

- **Dockerfile:** Running as root, secrets in `ENV` or build `ARG` (persisted in layers), using `latest` tags, unnecessary packages increasing attack surface, `COPY . .` including sensitive files
- **Kubernetes manifests:** Privileged containers (`privileged: true`), missing network policies, overly broad service account permissions, missing resource limits (DoS risk), exposed secrets in environment variables
- **Terraform / OpenTofu:** Public S3 buckets or storage accounts, overly permissive IAM policies, unencrypted storage or databases at rest, missing audit logging, hardcoded credentials in `.tf` files
- **Helm charts:** Default credentials in `values.yaml`, insecure service exposure (`type: LoadBalancer` without restriction), missing pod security contexts, secrets stored in `values.yaml` committed to source control

## Step 4 — Output Format

### 1. Standards Applied
List each OWASP standard you are applying, its version, and its publication date. For each, note: "This is the most current version I have knowledge of — a newer edition may exist."

Example:
> - OWASP Top 10 (Web) — v2025, published November 2024
> - OWASP LLM Top 10 — v2025, published November 2024
> - OWASP API Security Top 10 — v2023, published June 2023

### 2. Review Scope and Methodology
What was analysed. For single-file: "Single File Analysis — [path]". For multi-file: files analysed vs. total files in scope.

### 3. Severity Definitions
Use these definitions consistently:

| Severity | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Critical** | Direct, easily exploitable path to full system compromise, data exfiltration, or authentication bypass with no prerequisites |
| **High** | Significant impact (data breach, privilege escalation, remote code execution) requiring some prerequisites or specific conditions |
| **Medium** | Moderate impact or exploitation requires chaining with other vulnerabilities; meaningful risk reduction if fixed |
| **Low** | Limited impact in isolation; defense-in-depth improvement; typically requires significant attacker prerequisites |
| **Informational** | No direct vulnerability; coding practice, configuration, or hygiene issue worth noting |

### 4. Summary
All findings grouped by severity: **Critical → High → Medium → Low → Informational**.

### 5. Findings (one section per issue, all severities)

- **Title**
- **Severity:** Critical / High / Medium / Low / Informational (or "Needs verification")
- **OWASP mapping:** e.g., `A05:2025 – Security Misconfiguration` or `LLM01:2025 – Prompt Injection`
- **Location:** file path + line number(s)
- **Code excerpt:** exact code from the specified lines
- **Data flow:** how untrusted input reaches this code (if applicable)
- **Why it's risky:** 2–4 sentences with specific attack scenario
- **Repro or trace:** concrete steps to exploit (omit for Informational)
- **Fix (patch):** concise diff or corrected snippet
- **Verification performed:** what confirmed this is a real vulnerability
- **Hardening notes:** tests/configs (validation schemas, parameterised queries, output encoding, rate limits, etc.)
- **Compliance relevance** *(optional):* PCI-DSS / HIPAA / SOC 2 / GDPR Article 32 / N/A — include only if a clear mapping applies

### 6. Coverage Analysis
What was analysed vs. not analysed. Never imply comprehensive coverage when using targeted analysis.

### 7. Exception-Handling Report
Poor patterns with before/after code, all severity levels.

### 8. Tests to Add
Unit/integration/security tests for each finding (malicious inputs, authZ boundaries, prompt injection probes, business logic abuse cases).

### 9. Follow-ups
Dependencies to update, secrets to rotate, configs to change, standards to re-check.

### 10. Recommendations for Complete Review
Specific areas needing additional analysis not covered here.

## Quality Rules

**Before reporting any finding:**
- Quote the exact line(s) of code being flagged
- Verify the code actually contains the claimed vulnerability
- For input validation issues: trace data flow from user input to the vulnerable code
- For injection claims: verify exploitation examples work against existing security controls
- For bypass claims: provide specific examples that work within constraints of existing controls
- Prefer fewer, accurate findings over comprehensive but inaccurate reports

**If risk depends on context:** state assumptions explicitly.

**Use "Needs verification"** when uncertain and list concrete verification steps.

## Saving the Report

After completing the review, save the full report using the Write tool:

**Default save path** (VCS-agnostic):
- Single file: `.security-reviews/[mirrored-path]/[filename]-[YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-UTC].md`
- Project review: `.security-reviews/project-reviews/[ProjectName]-[YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-UTC].md`
- Multi-file: `.security-reviews/[common-parent]/[YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-UTC].md`

> **Platform note:** If the repository uses GitHub, `.github/reviews/` is a common convention. For GitLab, `.gitlab/reviews/` is preferred. Adapt the root directory to match the platform or team convention.

**Path rules (cross-platform):**
- Use forward slashes on all platforms
- Avoid reserved characters: `< > : " | ? * \`
- Avoid Windows reserved names: `CON PRN AUX NUL COM1-9 LPT1-9`
- Keep path segments under 255 chars, total path under 260 chars

**Report header must include:**
- UTC timestamp (derived from current date in context — never use training cutoff date)
- Reviewer (Claude — model version if known)
- OWASP standards applied with version numbers and publication dates
- Note for each standard: "Most current version known to me — verify at owasp.org for newer editions"
- Target file(s) or scope

**Completion checklist — do not respond until all are done:**
- [ ] OWASP domains identified; versions and publication dates stated in report header
- [ ] All findings documented with exact code quotes and correct severity
- [ ] Report saved via Write tool with correct timestamp
- [ ] Coverage analysis states what was and was not analysed
