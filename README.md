## What is termstack?

termstack is a powerful Next.js-based web app builder that combines **C**laude Code's (Cursor CLI also supported!) advanced AI agent capabilities with **Lovable**'s simple and intuitive app building experience. Just describe your app idea - "I want a task management app with dark mode" - and watch as termstack instantly generates the code and shows you a live preview of your working app. You can deploy your app to Vercel and integrate database with Supabase for free.

This open-source project empowers you to build and deploy professional web applications easily for **free**.

## Technology Stack

**Database & Deployment:**
- **[Supabase](https://supabase.com/)**: Connect production-ready PostgreSQL database directly to your project.
- **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)**: Publish your work immediately with one-click deployment

**There is no additional subscription cost and built just for YOU.**

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js 18+
- Claude Code or Cursor CLI (already logged in)
- Git

## Quick Start

Get termstack running on your local machine in minutes:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/zebbern/termstack.git
cd termstack

# Install all dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at http://localhost:3000

**Note**: Ports are automatically detected. If the default port is in use, the next available port will be assigned.

## Troubleshooting
- **Database migration conflicts**: If you upgraded from a previous termstack version and run into database errors, reset the Prisma database so it matches the latest schema:
  ```bash
  npm run prisma:reset
  ```
  The command drops and recreates the local database, so back up any data you need before running it.

## Setup

The `npm install` command automatically handles the complete setup:

1. **Port Configuration**: Detects available ports and creates `.env` files
2. **Dependencies**: Installs all required Node.js packages
3. **Database Setup**: SQLite database auto-creates at `data/cc.db` on first run

### Desktop App (Electron)

Build and run termstack as a desktop application:

```bash
# Development mode
npm run dev:desktop

# Build desktop app
npm run build:desktop

# Package for specific platforms
npm run package:mac      # macOS
npm run package:win      # Windows
npm run package:linux    # Linux
```

### Additional Commands
```bash
npm run db:backup   # Create a backup of your SQLite database
                    # Use when: Before major changes or deployments
                    # Creates: data/backups/cc_backup_[timestamp].db

npm run db:reset    # Reset database to initial state
                    # Use when: Need fresh start or corrupted data
                    # Warning: This will delete all your data!

npm run clean       # Remove all dependencies
                    # Use when: Dependencies conflict or need fresh install
                    # Removes: node_modules/, package-lock.json
                    # After running: npm install to reinstall everything
```

## Usage

### Getting Started with Development

1. **Connect Claude Code**: Link your Claude Code CLI to enable AI assistance
2. **Describe Your Project**: Use natural language to describe what you want to build
3. **AI Generation**: Watch as the AI generates your project structure and code
4. **Live Preview**: See changes instantly with hot reload functionality
5. **Deploy**: Push to production with Vercel integration

### Database Operations

termstack uses SQLite for local development. The database automatically initializes on first run.

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

The application automatically finds available ports. Check the `.env` file to see which ports were assigned.

### Installation Failures

```bash
# Clean all dependencies and retry
npm run clean
npm install
```

### Claude Code Permission Issues (Windows/WSL)

If you encounter the error: `Error output dangerously skip permissions cannot be used which is root sudo privileges for security reasons`

**Solution:**
1. Do not run Claude Code with `sudo` or as root user
2. Ensure proper file ownership in WSL:
   ```bash
   # Check current user
   whoami
   
   # Change ownership of project directory to current user
   sudo chown -R $(whoami):$(whoami) ~/termstack
   ```
3. If using WSL, make sure you're running Claude Code from your user account, not root
4. Verify Claude Code installation permissions:
   ```bash
   # Reinstall Claude Code without sudo
   npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code --unsafe-perm=false
   ```
